	<!-- unlabeled graph -->
	
	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial">The world of crypto currency is a crazy and very interesting world. Lots of new currencies and coins have been making headlines such as bitcoin and dogecoin. As coins continue to hit the market, consumers just keep buying new coins. That is why I have decided to release my new cryptocurrency</font></p></center> <!-- UNFINISHED -->

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial"> Two words spring to everyones mind when they think about cryptocurrency: Too complicated. Normal people like you and me don't know what a blockchain is and are not going to read an article or something like that to learn what it is. That's why I decided to develop a simple cryptocurrency that the average man or woman can understand: Quinns Coins. Quinns Coin is a coin with a value, that goes up and down. It starts off at five dollars but I'll probably raise it up to 6 at some point just as a sign of good faith for the people who buy it. If i run out of money or need to pay rent or something like that though I'll probably lower the value of the coin or just delete the coin all together. I'm just not really tryna have people selling their coins when I need that money. I also think the value is supposed to randomly go up and down or something like Bitcoin does. </font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial">My name is Quinn Tonelli, and I am a investor, ontropenewer, businessman, executive, CEO, and rapper. My favorite movies are probably scarface and boys in the hood. I really like scarface because the main character has a rags-to-riches story and I am trying to have a similar situation happen in my life. I first heard about investing from a friend who had made sixty bucks with the gamestop thing and I decided I should probably get in on that. I bought 10 $ worth of dogecoin and sold it for 13 which I know doesn't sound like a lot but 30% is actually kind of crazy. Let me put it this way: If I had put in 100,000$ I would have made 30,000$. Let me put it another way: If I had bought a million dollars worth, I would have made 300,000 dollars. With that money I probably could have bought a house, or ten cars. But I'll be honest with you, If i had made 300,000 dollars I probably would have taken that out and then DOUBLED it in other investments. </font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial"> You're probably wondering, how did you know to buy dogecoin? Did you read an article about it or get advice to buy it from a friend? The answer is neither. How did I know to buy dogecoin? I'll tell you: Raw intelligence. </font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial"> I am very intelligent. I attend Harvard University where I am recieving a degree in Mathmatics and Economics. All my teachers tell me I am very smart and my nickname around campus is "The Genius".</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial"> I aspire to be a top CEO like Elon Musk or Joe Rogan. I also enjoy listening to rap music as I relate to their lyrics about hustle and grind. </font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial">Hypothetical situation: You don't buy Quinn-Coin and you close out of this website. Boom, next day, the value TRIPLES. You could have bought just 1000 dollars worth  of quinn coin and then woken up the next day with 2000 MORE DOLLARS. You would probably feel really stupid and like you had totally missed out the next big thing. That's what sets Quinn's coin apart from other Coins on the market: Unlimited Potential©. You could buy JUST FIVE dollars worth of Quinn's Coin and wake up the next day with 1000000 DOLLARS!!!!! Theres literally no way of knowing how much money you could make if you buy JUST ONE coin.</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial"> Step Two in my plan is simple: Three words, #Social Media Marketing. Everyone knows that dogecoin blew up because everyone was posting memes about it. That's why all the Quinns Coins buyers are gonna have to make a bunch of funny memes about Quinns Coin and post them to their social media accounts to help get the word out. We gotta get QuinnCoin hashtag #Trending on twitter as soon as possible guys!! </font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="red" face="arial">Quinn's Coin: What's it all about ?</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial">Allow me to paint a pitcure for you, if you will. Imagine a world run by corrupt businessmen and politicians where the average person is persecuted and trampled down by society. Now imagine a man in this society who goes against the grain and who dares to be different in the face of many difficulties.</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="arial">I have just described to you the plot of the 2018 film, "Joker". While this is a great movie, it is also a very important simile to todays society. The world is indeed run by corrupt people who steal money from average people like you and me. But the worst of them all are the wall street bankers.. They steal a lot of money from us normal Americans and it's time for us to mount a revolution! According to r/wallstreetbets, Wall Street bankers stole 900 TRILLION dollars from Americans last year alone. This is messed up and needs to end. That's why 
	I decided to launch QuinnCoin so I could stick it to the bankers.</font></p></center>

	<center><p><font color="black" face="italic arial" size="1"> Pictured Above: The Wall Street Crash of 1929. The Wall Street Crash of 1929, also known as the Great Crash, was a major American stock market crash that occurred in the autumn of 1929. It started in September and ended late in October, when share prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed. It was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States, when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its aftereffects. The Great Crash is mostly associated with October 24, 1929, called Black Thursday, the day of the largest sell-off of shares in U.S. history, and October 29, 1929, called Black Tuesday, when investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signaled the beginning of the Great Depression.</font></p></center>
